## Ideas / Todo / May never happen...
# Performance
- Determine why we are missing images
- Possibly move to a parser, away from regex on html
- Address TODOs and FIXMEs within the code
- Consider adding/moving to `set -x` for debugging instead of just printing text.

# Function
- Preserve filenames for images (especially relevant for filename threads)
- Preserve names and tripcodes
- Add option to remove images deleted, as they are likely not worth keeping.
- Add report of how many images/posts were downloaded each update
- Add report of thread information to a file / option for stdout too
- Board Monitoring
    - Montior a board for and download any threads matching a particular regex pattern(s)
- Add option to download banners and contest banners
- Put all downloaded content within respective folders
- Add option to download sitewide misc data, popular threads shown on the site home,blog, etc
- Add option for all boards mode to be all sfw or nsfw boards
- Maintain information on what images are spoilered within the thread

# Pretty Printing

- Add progress indicator, no matter the mode we are in.
- Add prettyfication options for the update status. E.g. Let the lines of ='s be changed.
